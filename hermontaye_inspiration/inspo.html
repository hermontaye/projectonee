                                                <p>One of the brands that I’ve 
                                                been recently obsessed with is called Yuremane. Nik, the founder of 
                                                the brand, has a large following on social media and has built a 
                                                reputation for the brand's beautifully crafted selvedge jeans. 
                                                His brand is built off the importance of thoughtfulness and 
                                                craftsmanship and I admire that. I think those are very important 
                                                pillars to build a clothing brand on in today's society where 
                                                overconsumption and fast fashion is running rampant.</p>

                                                <p> One of my favorite creatives that I draw inspiration from is an artist 
                                                 that goes by the name Slawn. He’s a Nigerian born, UK raised 
                                                designer and artist that oftentimes, faces a lot of controversy 
                                                surrounding his art. What keeps me interested in his work is his 
                                                ability to work with all kinds of mediums. He has done works on 
                                                cars to painting other humans and while his art style is very 
                                                different from my own, I can still admire his skill and 
                                                creativity.</p>

                                                <p> The last creative is a graphic designer whose work I found on 
                                                Behance. His name is Tesfa GebreMariyam and he is based in the 
                                                country that I'm from, Ethiopia. His work is totally mesmerizing. 
                                                He uses bright, contrasting colors to evoke certain emotions while 
                                                also incorporating traditional Ethiopian art styles into his designs 
                                                and patterns.</p>
