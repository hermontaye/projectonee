                    <h1> Who Is Hermon Taye?</h1>

                        <p> My name is Hermon Taye and art has been an integral part of my 
                            life for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I was always drawn 
                            to creative expression, whether through drawing, crafting, or simply 
                            experimenting with different materials. What really pulled me 
                            toward art was how it allows people to express emotions and ideas 
                            without needing words. I was always fascinated by how colors, shapes, 
                            and designs could tell a story or make people feel something. Over time, 
                            this love for creating led me to study visual communications at 
                            San Francisco State University, where I’m now in my third year.

                            In addition to digital art and drawing, I also enjoy sewing and 
                            making things by hand. During the pandemic, I decided to teach myself 
                            how to sew and I'm so grateful for that decision. I’ve taken old clothes 
                            I don’t wear anymore and turned them into bags, which has been an incredibly 
                            fun and rewarding way to repurpose materials. I love the process of taking 
                            something unused and transforming it into something new. Whether I’m working 
                            digitally or with fabric, I enjoy the challenge of bringing ideas to life.
<br> 
<br>   
                            Right now, I’m excited to learn more about digital art and all the 
                            possibilities it offers. I’m still getting familiar with it, but from what 
                            I know so far, it seems like such a cool and creative field with so many 
                            opportunities. After college, I hope to use my art in a way that combines 
                            creativity with practical design, whether that’s in branding, illustration, 
                            or something else in visual communications.
